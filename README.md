# Rainbow-Six-Tracker
## What the hell is this?
Yeah so this was just a school project. Nothing going on here...
<br>
<br>
But for the ones who do want to look into this:
This was a simple java application. The goal was as followed:
- I need to create a Java console-application.
- The application has to conform to the basic elements of Object Oriented Programming;
  - There have to be at least 3 Classes
  - All Classes have attributes and methods.
- The application has to be able to write and/or read files.
  - Make sure that this is safe. (Base64)
Please note, this is not an efficiently programmed application. I haven't worked on this after the due date, and do currently not plan on continuing.

## So what does it do?
This application is an database application, without actually being a database. It is made for the popular fps (game) Rainbow Six Siege. You can write your match results, and it will save them to several files. You can also ask the application to read the files for you. It will do this based on Operator (game character).
I'm to lasy to find out how I made this application, as when I am writing it is already been 2 years ago.
