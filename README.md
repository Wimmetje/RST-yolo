Yeah so this was just a school project. Nothing going on here...

But for the ones who do want to research this:
This was a simple java application. The goal was as followed:
- I need to create a Java console-application.
- The application has to conform to the basic elements of Object Oriented Programming;
  - There have to be at least 3 Classes
  - All Classes have attributes and methods.
- The application has to be able to write and/or read files.
  - Make sure that this is safe. (Base64)
